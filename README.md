## TanStack CodeBreaker

<strong>Code</strong>Breaker is a sample project for a simple Code-Breaking Game. Basically an automated way
to create little "code-breaking" worksheets where each letter in a secret message is represented as a symbol.
Kids can then refer to an alphabet lookup table, and perform the translation.

This project is built using React, TypeScript, TanStack Router, TanStack DB and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a
demonstration of how to use these technologies together to create an interactive web application. Also a way
for me to experiment with TanStack in a small project.
